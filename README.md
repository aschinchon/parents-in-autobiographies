# Parents in autobiographies

Imagine that you are writing the story of your life. Almost sure you will make allusions to your parents, but will both of them have the same prominence in your biography or will you spend more words in one of them? In that case, which one will have more relevance? Your father or your mother?

This experiment analyses 118 autobiographies from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and count how many times do authors make allusions to their fathers and mothers.
